        Azeotropes are a consequence of non-ideality in mixtures. In this report,
        we demonstrate the utility of the two-parameter Margules
        activity model in describing azeotropes. Constants were fit from obtained
        constant-temperature VLE data in literature, and such were used to construct
        pressure-composition plots. Azeotropes were also predicted using the activity
        model. It was found out that the trends observed for the predicted data
        generally agreed with the atmospheric pressure azeotrope.
