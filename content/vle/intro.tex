One way the Gibbs free energy of mixing is accounted for is by introducing
excess free energy functions. One such model is the Margules activity model
introduced in the late 19th century. A simplified expression of the model
is the following two-parameter form for a binary system
\begin{equation}\label{eq:margules-two-param}
    \dfrac1{RT} \Delta G_{mix} = x_1x_2 \qty[A_{21}x_1 + A_{12}x_2],
\end{equation}
where the constants $A_{21}$ and $A_{12}$ are usually derived from vapor--liquid
equilibrium experiments. These experiments show compositions of liquids in a
solution and corresponding vapor compositions at given temperatures or pressures.

In this account, we present a demonstration of the utility of the Margules
activity model in explaining some important physical phenomena that are
consequences of deviations from the ideal behavior of fluids primarily
focusing on azeotropy.
