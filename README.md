# Vapor--Liquid equilibria

This repository contains LaTeX source files and `Pluto.jl` notebooks
used in writing an article in partial fulfillment of the requirements of
Physical Chemistry C.

The PDF of the article can easily be made using `make`. This assumes the
user has both `make` and `latexmk` installed. Otherwise, it is possible to
build using `pdflatex`.

Reactive notebooks are written in Julia using `Pluto.jl` and are exported
to HTML. A Github Pages site may be set up soon.
