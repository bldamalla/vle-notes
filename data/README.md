## Data directory README

This contains information on this directory.

The folders are named such that the first component is the one at the left
of the folder name. The name to the right is the second component. 

Filenames starting with `P` are measured at a constant pressure. They are 
followed by the pressure (P/torr) in which it is measured. In this case,
temperature measurements are in Celsius.

Filenames starting with `T` are measured at a constant temperature. 
They are followed by the temperature (T/C) in which it is measured. In this
case, pressure measurements are in bars.
